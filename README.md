**Architecture**

Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).
Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?

The two types of frontend development I worked on in this project was a static MVC webpage with Express and a SPA webpage with Angular. They key difference in their architecture was that the Express webpage used server-side rendering and would need to reload the entire webpage to change something and the SPA with Angular used client-side rendering and could reload only a single small component on a webpage when it needed to update something on the page.

**Functionality**

How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?
Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies, and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components.

JSON is a standardized way to organize data so that it can be understood by different applications and interpretted the same way regardless of architecture or tech stack. In this project it was used to provide a means of communicating information between the backend and frontend of the project in a way both could interpret.
This project began as an MVC Express based webpage and then added in a SPA Angular webpage. While they both did similar jobs, the way they achieved their goals was fundementally different and meant that the code had to be refactored many times to break it into components that could be reused and updated individually as needed.

**Testing**

Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security. Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application.

The testing done on this project was manual. I used Postman and browser inspect tools to view the data as it was being handed between the frontend and backend to ensure that the data integrity was intact after communications. 

**Reflection**

How has this course helped you in reaching your professional goals? What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?

This course was a whirlwind of information but by the end it finally began to settle and more than any one tech stack I feel I learned how to break through challenges that come from having so many different pieces of code talking to one another. A skill I improved on was how to look at a problem and say "This is what I expect to happen, what could be the root issue that causes that to not take place" and that gave me a great starting point to work through problems with.
